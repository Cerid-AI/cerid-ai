  - Inline enable/disable toggles per API
  - Add 3+ free public APIs: DuckDuckGo Instant Answers, Open Library, PubChem
  - Move data sources from System tab to more prominent Essentials location
  - Each follows `DataSource` ABC pattern in `utils/data_sources/`

- [ ] **Watched Folders Management**
  - CRUD API: `POST/GET/PATCH/DELETE /watched-folders` with Redis storage
  - Per-folder: enable/disable, domain override, exclude patterns, search_enabled toggle
  - Per-folder scan isolation (namespaced Redis state keys)
  - Tag ingested artifacts with `watched_folder_id` in ChromaDB metadata
  - `search_enabled: false` excludes folder's chunks from RAG queries
  - Settings UI: folder list with toggles, scan button, stats, add/remove
  - Optional per-folder external DB binding (architecture hook, Pro tier)

- [ ] **RAG Orchestration Resilience**
  - Source availability awareness (check enabled + configured before querying)
  - Folder-aware domain routing (`exclude_folder_ids` filter in decomposer)
  - Graceful degradation: partial source_breakdown on failure, circuit breaker awareness
  - Per-source timing (`_timings: {kb_ms, memory_ms, external_ms}`)
  - `source_status` in response: `{kb: "ok", memory: "timeout", external: "ok"}`

- [ ] **Ollama Content Triage (Bulk Import)**
  - When Ollama enabled, use it for content value assessment during folder scan
  - Score 1-5 (skip low-value, ingest high-value, adjust quality_score)
  - Async, non-blocking, falls back to heuristic scoring
  - `ENABLE_AI_TRIAGE` env var (default: true when Ollama enabled)

- [ ] **Direct Provider SDKs**
  - Add direct API key support for Anthropic, OpenAI, Google (bypass OpenRouter)
  - Provider selection in settings: OpenRouter (default) vs direct API
  - Key validation per provider
  - Preserves OpenRouter as fallback aggregator

- [ ] **Expanded File Type Handling**
  - Specialized parsers for code files (AST extraction for Python, JS/TS, Go, Rust)
  - Table-aware Excel parsing (preserve sheet structure, formulas as metadata)
  - Image OCR for scanned PDFs (Pro tier, requires Tesseract or LLM vision)
  - Audio transcription for meeting notes (Pro tier, requires Whisper)
  - Markdown frontmatter extraction (YAML/TOML headers → metadata)

- [ ] **Pro Tier Purchase Path**
  - Stripe integration for Pro tier licensing
  - License key validation endpoint
  - Self-serve upgrade flow from Core → Pro in Settings
  - Usage-based or per-seat pricing model
  - Waitlist/early access program as interim

- [ ] **Startup Wizard & Setup Streamlining**
  - Web-based first-run wizard (runs before main app if no config detected)
  - Docker detection and auto-install guidance
  - API key setup with provider validation
  - Ollama install option integrated into wizard
  - Remove age encryption requirement for first-time setup
  - Pre-built Docker images on GitHub Container Registry (skip local build)
  - Target: actual 5-minute setup for Docker-ready users

- [ ] **SSO / SAML Implementation (Enterprise)**
  - SAML 2.0 SP implementation with IdP metadata import
  - Integration with common IdPs (Okta, Azure AD, OneLogin)
  - Tenant-scoped SSO configuration
  - Currently scaffolded as feature flag only — needs full implementation

- [ ] **Separate Trading Tools**
  - Move 5 trading MCP tools to cerid-trading-agent repo
  - Trading tools become an external integration via SDK
  - Core Cerid repo ships 21 MCP tools (no trading dependency)
  - Trading agent connects via A2A protocol or SDK endpoints

- [ ] **Bulk Import Remaining Features**
  - Ollama content triage (score 1-5 for value assessment)
  - Persistent import queue (Redis-backed, survives restarts)
  - File type error recovery (magic byte sniffing, fallback parsing)
  - Import progress in Knowledge Console UI
  - Scheduled folder re-scan (cron-based watch)

- [ ] **Private Mode (Ephemeral Sessions)**
  - Toggle in toolbar or settings: "Private Mode" — nothing remembered, nothing saved
  - Conversation not added to history, memories not extracted, feedback loop disabled
  - Configurable security levels:
    - Level 1 (default): no history, no memory extraction
    - Level 2: also disable KB context injection (pure LLM, no local data exposure)
    - Level 3: also force local-only models (Ollama), no external API calls
    - Level 4: also clear Redis query cache on session end
  - Visual indicator in chat panel (lock icon, muted toolbar) so user knows mode is active
  - Session data wiped on conversation close (not just hidden)

- [ ] **Conversation Management UX**
  - Hover-reveal action buttons on each conversation in sidebar history:
    - Delete (trash icon) — removes from history with confirmation
    - Archive (box icon) — moves to archived state (saved but hidden from main list)
  - Archived conversations accessible via "View archived" toggle at bottom of history
  - Bulk select/delete for history cleanup
  - Search within conversation history

- [ ] **Pro Mode Configuration & Feature Access**
  - Clear Pro settings pane showing all Pro-gated features with status
  - Feature discovery: show what Pro unlocks with preview/demo for each
  - Pro feature toggle dashboard (enable/disable individual Pro features)
  - License key entry and validation in settings
  - Visual distinction between Core and Pro UI elements throughout

- [ ] **Agent Communication Console**
  - Optional console-style panel (toggle from toolbar or settings)
  - Real-time ticker-scroll showing agent activity:
    - "Query Agent → decomposing into 3 sub-queries..."
    - "Decomposer → searching finance domain..."
    - "Verification Agent → checking claim 2/4 against KB..."
  - Color-coded by agent (brand teal for retrieval, gold for verification, etc.)
  - Collapsible/dockable panel (bottom or side position)
  - Filterable by agent type
  - Useful for debugging, transparency, and "seeing the intelligence work"

- [ ] **Model Management & Auto-Update Detection**
  - Dedicated model management pane in Settings (separate from pipeline settings)
  - Shows all available models with: provider, cost, context window, capabilities
  - Auto-detection of new model releases via OpenRouter API polling
  - Notification badge when new models are available ("3 new models available")
  - One-click model update: swap to newer version with capability comparison
  - Model deprecation warnings (e.g., "GPT-4o is superseded by GPT-5.4")
  - Cost comparison view: current model vs alternatives
  - Prevent casual users from being stuck on outdated models

- [ ] **Enterprise Feature Scaffolding**
  - All Enterprise/Vault features should have:
    - Feature flag in `config/features.py` (already done for most)
    - Router endpoint stubs returning 403 with upgrade message
    - UI placeholders in Settings showing "Available in Cerid Vault"
    - Documentation in TIER_MATRIX.md (already done)
  - Actual implementation deferred to future enterprise development phase
  - Scaffolded features: SSO/SAML, advanced audit logging, SIEM export,
    tenant management UI, compliance reporting, dedicated support portal

### Execution Dependencies

- **Phases A + B** can run in parallel (infrastructure vs settings)
- **Phase C** comes after A+B merge (moves files they modify)
- **Phase D** starts after A is done (needs unified compose)
- **Feature phases (42-50)** are independent of infrastructure phases
- **Phase 48** (Ollama) implements as a BYOK provider from Phase B
- **Phase 46** (multi-modal) requires Phase C4 plugin packaging

### Business Model

- **Core + App** (Apache-2.0): KB, RAG, verification, SDK, GUI — always free
- **Plugins** (BSL-1.1): Multi-modal, advanced analytics, visual workflow — paid, source-available, converts to Apache-2.0 after 3 years
- **Enterprise** (Commercial): Team features, SLA, priority support
- **BYOK**: Users bring their own LLM provider keys. No cerid-hosted LLM costs.

## Phase 39B: MCP Performance & Rate Limiting Overhaul (2026-03-16) ✅

Systemic evaluation and optimization of rate limiting, circuit breakers, and server-side
infrastructure for the cerid-ai / cerid-trading-agent integration (5 sessions, up to 67.5 calls/min worst-case burst).

### Trading Agent Client Fixes
- [x] Memory queries bypass oracle circuit breaker (`oracle.py`) — non-critical memory failures no longer trip the oracle breaker
- [x] Circuit breaker recovery timeout 60s → 20s (`settings.py`) — ample for local Docker restart + health check
- [x] Split rate limiter into oracle (50/min) + memory (20/min) independent pools (`cerid_client.py`) — oracle queries cannot be starved by background memory calls
- [x] Oracle result cache with 20s TTL (`cerid_client.py`) — 5 sessions hitting same signal = 1 cerid call instead of 5
- [x] 2-second session start stagger (`manager.py`) — eliminates t=0 startup burst

### Server-Side Fixes (cerid-ai)
- [x] Raise `trading-agent` rate limit 60 → 80 req/min (`config/settings.py`) — server no longer the binding constraint (client pools = 70/min are)
- [x] Neo4j pagecache 512 MB → 2 GB, container limit 2G → 4G (`infrastructure/docker-compose.yml`) — full graph in memory, ~600ms disk-read penalty eliminated
- [x] Graph traversal wrapped in `asyncio.to_thread()` (`query_agent.py:357`) — event loop freed during Neo4j Bolt call
- [x] Quality/summaries Neo4j call wrapped in `asyncio.to_thread()` (`query_agent.py:999`) — second blocking call offloaded to thread pool
- [x] BM25 search wrapped in `asyncio.to_thread()` (`query_agent.py:243`) — tokenization no longer blocks event loop
- [x] Quantized int8 ONNX reranker `model_quint8_avx2.onnx` (23 MB) replaces float32 `model.onnx` (91 MB) (`Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`) — 3-4× faster cross-encoder inference

### Performance Results
| Metric | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Cold query latency | ~2.0s | ~1.7-1.8s |
| ONNX model size | 91 MB | 22 MB |
| Concurrent throughput | Serialized (event loop blocked) | Parallel (3 ops offloaded) |
| Oracle calls for 5-session signal burst | 5 | 1 (cache) |
| Circuit breaker recovery | 60s | 20s |

## Task: Activate Semantic Cache (Phase 40 Candidate)

**Status:** Blocked — requires embedding model migration
**Tracked in:** `docs/ISSUES.md` → M1

**Why blocked:** `ENABLE_SEMANTIC_CACHE=true` is set but the cache never activates. It requires a
client-side embedding function to compute query embeddings for HNSW similarity matching. The default
embedding model (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) runs server-side inside ChromaDB — `get_embedding_function()`
returns `None`, so no query embedding is ever computed and the HNSW index is never populated.

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] **1. Choose client-side embedding model**
  - Recommended: `Snowflake/snowflake-arctic-embed-m-v1.5` (768d, 8192 ctx, MTEB SOTA for its size)
  - Alternative: `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` ONNX (384d, faster, backward compatible dim)
  - Set `EMBEDDING_MODEL=Snowflake/snowflake-arctic-embed-m-v1.5` in `.env` (or docker-compose.yml)

- [ ] **2. Update Dockerfile**
  - Add ONNX model download for chosen embedding model (alongside reranker downloads)
  - Use quantized variant if available (same pattern as `model_quint8_avx2.onnx`)

- [ ] **3. Update `SEMANTIC_CACHE_DIM` in `config/features.py`**
  - Match the model's output dimension: 768 for Arctic, 384 for MiniLM
  - `SEMANTIC_CACHE_DIM = int(os.getenv("SEMANTIC_CACHE_DIM", "768"))`

- [ ] **4. Re-ingest full KB**
  - Existing ChromaDB collections use server-side embeddings — incompatible dimension/space
  - Per-domain: `DELETE /kb-admin/clear-domain/{domain}` then re-run file watcher / manual ingest
  - Zero-downtime option: create new `-v2` collections, cut over, delete old (more complex)

- [ ] **5. Verify cache activates**
  - Enable `ENABLE_STEP_TIMER=true` temporarily
  - Check `semantic_cache` step in query response latency breakdown
  - Second semantically similar query should show cache hit in logs (`semantic_cache: hit`)

- [ ] **6. Benchmark**
  - Warm cache query: should fall between Redis exact-match (~7ms) and full retrieval (~1.7s)
  - Measure HNSW hit rate across real trading agent queries

**Files:** `config/features.py`, `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`, `utils/embeddings.py`, `utils/semantic_cache.py`, `deps.py`

#### 27A: Robust Host Detection ✅
- [x] `detect_lan_ip()` function — iterates en0–en5, ifconfig scan, Linux hostname -I, with source logging
- [x] Force-recreate cerid-web when VITE_MCP_URL changes (prevents stale IP bug)

#### 27B: Pre-flight Validation ✅
- [x] `preflight_checks()` function — port conflict detection, required env var validation, disk space warning
- [x] `--force` flag to bypass pre-flight checks
- [x] Own-container skip (don't flag our running containers as conflicts)

#### 27C: Post-startup Reachability Validation ✅
- [x] Bifrost added to health wait chain
- [x] LAN MCP URL reachability check with actionable diagnostics
- [x] Structured colored health output via `check_health()` helper
- [x] Exit code 2 for partial start (critical services unreachable)

#### 27D: First-Run Experience ✅
- [x] `setup.sh` rewritten as guided 7-step installer (delegates to start-cerid.sh)
- [x] Interactive API key prompt + auto-generate NEO4J_PASSWORD
- [x] Idempotent — safe to re-run
- [x] `.env.example` inline `# REQUIRED` markers with signup URLs
- [x] `CONTRIBUTING.md` Quick Start + stale counts updated

#### 27E: Configuration Flexibility ✅
- [x] `CERID_PORT_*` env vars (8 ports) in 4 docker-compose files
- [x] `start-cerid.sh` exports port defaults, uses them in preflight/health/URLs
- [x] `.env.example` Port Overrides section
- [x] `docs/ENV_CONVENTIONS.md` Port Overrides table + naming rule

### Backlog

#### Verification UX
- [ ] Verification pane should show cards for the most recent response only; clicking a previous assistant reply should swap to that message's verification cards (currently verification state does not clear and re-run per reply)

#### Attachment & Privacy
- [ ] Attachment hand-off across model switches — ensure the next model receives the attachment (or relevant extracted data) when Bifrost routes to a different provider mid-conversation
- [ ] Privacy-aware attachment processing — pre-process attachments into KB artifact facts/context selections before outbound LLM calls, avoiding full-file transmission while keeping the UX seamless ("it just works")

#### Chat / History UX
- [ ] History pane: show trash/delete icon on mouseover of each conversation line item (not always visible)
- [ ] Move "New Chat" button out of the history list — place it near the top beside the Chat tab for easier access

### Dropped
- [x] ~~D2: Conversation fork/branch UI~~ — Dropped (2026-03-08). Core model-switch UX complete; fork UI has unclear ROI for 40-60 hrs
